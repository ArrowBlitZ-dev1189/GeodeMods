[BROKEN: DOESN'T WORK 100% OF THE TIME] Invisible Pause on New Best: When you die with a new best on a level, it pauses everything (doesn't bring up the menu) so you can see where you died. Only restarts when you pause (clicking ESC) and restart, sadly.

Practice music hack: (Modification of a mod by @camila314) that fixes the bug where it wont stop playing music when dying while invisible

REALLY Accurate Percentage (Modification of a mod by @camila314): Individual mod file of Accurate Percentage, extended to 5 decimals.

Safe Progress: A mod that - when enabled - doesn't save your progress on a level. This mod doesn't just exit you out before you die or complete a level, it fully stops saving progress. This will be useful when noclipping and/or speedhacking

No Mirror Flip: A mod that stops mirror portals from flipping your screen. Portals will still render/show particles, but won't flip your screen.

No Wave Streak: A mod that removes the thick wave trail entirely

FPS Ripoff: A mod that changes the font of @camila314's FPS Viewer (and finally removes the black box). Requested by @Seaze.

No Pulse Ripoff: @Kriega77 https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/979352389985390603/992863410620477532

[NOT DONE: CODE MAY BE INCOMPLETE OR MAY MALFUNCTION] Ultra Rainbow (Modification of a mod by @camila314): Rainbow Hack, but with individual player colors.
